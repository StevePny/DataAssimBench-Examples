# Notebooks for Solvik, K.; Penny, S. G.; Hoyer, S. (forthcoming)

The notebooks in this directory recreate the experiments and figures for a forthcoming manuscript introducing "Backprop-4DVar", a variant of the incremental 4D-Var data assimilation algorithm.

There are 3 sets of experiments: Lorenz-96, PyQG quasi-geostrophic, and QGS quasi-geostrophic with a reservoir computing forecast model. Each set of experiments should be run in alphabetical order, e.g. 1A before 1B, 1B before 1C. Usually, the first notebook runs hyper-parameter optimization to find the best learning rate and learning rate decay for Backprop-4DVar. Then the next notebooks run the full experiment to evaluate performance on the test set and create figures. 

For full details, see: (link to manuscript will be added after submission).
